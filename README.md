# machine-learning-using-expression-trees
Uses a genetic algorithm to find a function matching a set of data points

WIP - very incomplete. Full version should feature a UI, ability to upload a dataset in the form of a JSON or CSV file, and should graph the final function against the data points to demonstrate its success (or failure)

To use this program, edit "data_points.py" to provide training data. Run main.py and enter the number of generations desired. The program will tell you the best function it can find that matches the set of data points given
